                    <h3>Query-Crafting DoS Threats Against Internet DNS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Recent DoS attacks against DNS (e.g., Dyn) show that disrupting DNS availability cascades into widespread service outages. This work studies a distinct DoS vector—query-crafting attacks, where adversaries generate specially crafted domain-name payloads to maximize per-query cost rather than relying solely on flooding or amplification. By modeling DNS with a state diagram, the authors identify threat vectors involving invalid, random, and mixed-structure domain names that force extra resolver processing. Internet measurements confirm that such queries increase resolver communication and latency. The authors propose defense features tailored to detecting query-crafting behaviors and evaluate a prototype on CloudLab.

                    <h3>Distributed Security Network Functions against Botnet Attacks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Botnets continue to dominate network attacks due to their distributed nature, scale, and diverse techniques, limiting effectiveness of centralized defenses. This paper proposes a distributed security architecture leveraging SDN/NFV and machine learning to counter large-scale disruptive botnet attacks. Distributed network functions monitor protocol-specific traffic, detect known attacks, and forward essential real-time data to an SDN controller. The controller performs advanced machine-learning analysis to detect large-scale distributed attacks and dynamically updates flow rules or enforces routing controls. Evaluations show system efficiently detects both local and widespread botnet attacks, providing an effective, scalable defense mechanism.

                    "Nikhil and I worked together on Windows projects including C++/C# development,
                     automation and automation frameworks supporting product and test of SAN storage
                     and OS services. I found him to be an astute developer who produces high quality
                     outcomes. He was always learning and looking for ways to grow and expand his
                     knowledge base and skillset. He embraces the challenge and is persistent in
                     his pursuit of the right solution for the problem. I was always impressed with
                     his ability to diversify his expertise, being so well versed in multiple, separate,
                     technologies. It was a joy to have him as a teammate and I would be fortunate to have
                     the opportunity to work with him in the future."

                    project under me at SJSU. He was a smart and reliable student and he had good 
                    troubleshooting skills. He contributed several research articles with me during 
                    his master's program. He has good soft skills too. Any employer will satisfy his 
                    personality and good engineering skills. Even though I had recieved a lot of requests 
                    from students about such recommendation requests, It is my first recommendation for 
                    one of SJSU students during my professorship on 7/4/2020 (Independence Day). 
                    I would like to remember this date myself. :-)"

                    the security of the Domain Name Server (DNS) infrastructure, and I am pleased to 
                    recommend Nikhil. During the project Nikhil demonstrated a strong aptitude to learn 
                    new technical concepts and implement them. Specifically, Nikhil was able to develop an 
                    understanding of the DNS servers' distributed architecture and subsequently reproduce 
                    that architecture on a virtual environment for a simulation of DNS requests' processing. 
                    Furthermore, Nikhil demonstrated a competency in the effective use of Unix commands through 
                    a Unix cmd line interface."
